# Star

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

## Rationale

This application interacts an API backend ( http://swapi.co) containing useful Star Wars Lore such as characters, planets, films, vehicles, species, starships. 
It has been implemented in Angular 6 and and gives access some useful information such as character specs, planet details, and much more. This application can be further developed to include a much richer set of tools that would give Star Wars fans (such as myself!) a greater insight into the imagination of how this universe was assembled.
